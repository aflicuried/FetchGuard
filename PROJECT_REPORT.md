## Introduction

### Background

Cardiotocography (CTG) is a continuous electronic recording of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions during pregnancy and labor. CTG interpretation is crucial for detecting fetal distress and preventing adverse outcomes. However, manual CTG interpretation is subjective and prone to inter-observer variability.

### Objective

Develop and evaluate machine learning models for automated CTG classification into three categories:
- **Normal** (Class 0): Low risk, healthy fetus
- **Suspect** (Class 1): Moderate risk, requires monitoring
- **Pathological** (Class 2): High risk, immediate intervention needed

### Dataset

- **Size**: 2,126 CTG recordings
- **Features**: 21 numerical features extracted from CTG signals
- **Class Distribution**: Imbalanced (Normal: 77.8%, Suspect: 13.8%, Pathological: 8.3%)
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository

5. **Clinical Safety**: Only XGBoost meets the >90% pathological sensitivity threshold without augmentation

---

### Impact of SMOTE and Class Weighting

Class imbalance is a critical challenge in medical datasets. The pathological class represents only 8.3% of samples, leading to models that may achieve high overall accuracy while failing to detect critical cases.

#### What is SMOTE?

**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** addresses class imbalance by:
- Generating synthetic samples for minority classes
- Creating new instances along line segments between existing minority samples
- Balancing class distribution without simply duplicating existing samples
- Improving model's ability to learn minority class patterns

#### What is Class Weighting?

**Class Weighting** assigns higher importance to minority classes during training:
- Penalizes misclassification of minority classes more heavily
- Adjusts the loss function to account for class imbalance
- For XGBoost: Uses `sample_weight` parameter with balanced weights
- For Random Forest: Uses `class_weight='balanced'` parameter

#### Why These Techniques Matter:

**Clinical Context**: In fetal health monitoring:
- Missing a pathological case (False Negative) can be life-threatening
- False positives (overcautious predictions) are clinically acceptable
- Minority class detection is MORE important than overall accuracy

**Example Impact**:
- **Without augmentation**: Model may achieve 95% accuracy but only 70% pathological sensitivity
- **With SMOTE + class_weight**: Model achieves 94% accuracy with 88% pathological sensitivity
- **Clinical preference**: The second model is superior despite lower overall accuracy

### XGBoost Analysis

We evaluated three XGBoost configurations to assess robustness to preprocessing:

1. **XGB-Baseline**: Clean data, no SMOTE, no sample_weight
2. **XGB-Normalized**: Normalized data, no SMOTE, no sample_weight
3. **XGB-Balanced**: Clean data, no SMOTE, sample_weight='balanced'

**Note**: XGBoost uses `sample_weight` instead of `class_weight` parameter. Sample weights are computed using scikit-learn's `compute_sample_weight('balanced', y)` function.

## Medical Analysis and Interpretation

### Feature Importance Analysis

Understanding which CTG features drive model predictions is crucial for:
- **Clinical validation**: Ensuring models align with medical knowledge
- **Trust building**: Allowing clinicians to verify model reasoning
- **Feature monitoring**: Prioritizing which measurements to optimize
- **Model debugging**: Identifying potential biases or errors

We analyzed feature importance using two complementary methods:
1. **Model-based importance**: Direct from Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms
2. **SHAP values**: Model-agnostic explainability technique

#### Model-Based Feature Importance

![Model Feature Importance](plot/feature_importance/01_model_importance_comparison.png)

**Figure 19**: Side-by-side comparison of feature importance from Random Forest and XGBoost. Both models show strong agreement on top features, though with some ranking differences.

**Random Forest Top Features**:

**Figure 21**: Heatmap visualization showing importance values for top 15 features across both models. Darker colors indicate higher importance.

#### Consensus Feature Ranking

![Consensus Ranking](plot/feature_importance/04_consensus_feature_ranking.png)

**Figure 22**: Average feature importance across RF and XGBoost models. Top 5 features highlighted with red borders represent the most robust predictors.

**Top 5 Consensus Features** (averaged across RF and XGBoost):

| Rank | Feature | Avg Importance | Medical Definition | Clinical Significance |
|------|---------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | **Mean** | 0.1153 | Mean Fetal Heart Rate | Baseline FHR; normal range 110-160 bpm. Deviations indicate distress. |
| 2 | **MSTV** | 0.1143 | Mean Short Term Variability | Beat-to-beat FHR variation. Reduced variability suggests hypoxia. |
| 3 | **ALTV** | 0.1092 | Abnormal Long Term Variability | Minutes-scale FHR variation abnormalities. Indicator of autonomic dysfunction. |
| 4 | **ASTV** | 0.1017 | Abnormal Short Term Variability | Seconds-scale FHR variation abnormalities. Loss suggests fetal acidosis. |
| 5 | **DP** | 0.0893 | Prolonged Decelerations | FHR drops lasting >2 minutes. Critical warning sign of cord compression or hypoxia. |

#### Clinical Interpretation of Top Features:

##### 1. Mean FHR (Importance: 0.1153)

**Medical Definition**: The average fetal heart rate over the monitoring period.

**Normal Range**: 110-160 beats per minute (bpm)

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Baseline assessment**: Establishes fetal cardiovascular status
- **Bradycardia** (<110 bpm): May indicate fetal hypoxia, heart block, or maternal medication effects
- **Tachycardia** (>160 bpm): Associated with maternal fever, fetal infection, or hypoxia
- **Why it's important**: Provides the fundamental baseline for all other heart rate interpretations

**Impact on Classification**:
- Mean FHR deviations from normal range strongly correlate with pathological outcomes
- Models use this as a primary discriminator between normal and abnormal cases
- Combined with variability metrics, provides comprehensive fetal status assessment

##### 2. MSTV - Mean Short Term Variability (Importance: 0.1143)

**Medical Definition**: Average beat-to-beat variation in fetal heart rate measured over short time intervals (seconds).

**Normal Range**: Typically >3-5 bpm variation

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Reflects autonomic nervous system function**: Indicates intact fetal nervous system
- **Reduced variability** (<2 bpm): Suggests fetal sleep cycles, medication, or concerning hypoxia
- **Absent variability**: Critical sign of fetal acidosis or neurological compromise
- **Why it's important**: One of the most reliable indicators of fetal well-being

**Impact on Classification**:
- Sharp discriminator between normal and pathological states
- Reduced MSTV is a red flag requiring immediate clinical attention
- Models heavily weight this feature for pathological class prediction

##### 3. ALTV - Abnormal Long Term Variability (Importance: 0.1092)

**Medical Definition**: Abnormal patterns in FHR variations occurring over minutes-long cycles.

**Normal Pattern**: Smooth, cyclical variations between 5-25 bpm over 20-minute periods

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Autonomic regulation**: Reflects balance between sympathetic/parasympathetic systems
- **Abnormal patterns**: Indicate fetal stress, cord compression, or uteroplacental insufficiency
- **Sinusoidal pattern**: Specific ALTV abnormality suggesting severe fetal anemia or hypoxia
- **Why it's important**: Captures longer-term fetal adaptation to stress

**Impact on Classification**:
- Distinguishes suspect from pathological cases
- Abnormal ALTV patterns often precede acute decompensation
- Critical for early intervention timing

##### 4. ASTV - Abnormal Short Term Variability (Importance: 0.1017)

**Medical Definition**: Abnormal beat-to-beat FHR variation patterns occurring over seconds.

**Normal Pattern**: Irregular, constantly varying heart rate (5-25 bpm range)

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Lost variability**: Most concerning pattern, indicates acidosis or CNS depression
- **Excessive variability**: May indicate early hypoxia or cord complications
- **Smooth baseline**: Lack of micro-variability suggests fetal compromise
- **Why it's important**: Earliest detectable sign of fetal distress

**Impact on Classification**:
- Primary feature for pathological class identification
- ASTV abnormalities trigger immediate clinical review
- High sensitivity for detecting deteriorating fetal status

##### 5. DP - Prolonged Decelerations (Importance: 0.0893)

**Medical Definition**: Abrupt decreases in FHR lasting 2-10 minutes.

**Normal**: Absent or rare (<2 per hour)

**Clinical Significance**:
- **Umbilical cord compression**: Most common cause, may indicate cord around neck
- **Uteroplacental insufficiency**: Suggests inadequate oxygen delivery
- **Acute hypoxia**: Prolonged decelerations indicate ongoing oxygen deprivation
- **Emergency indicator**: May require immediate delivery if recurrent or severe
- **Why it's important**: Direct evidence of fetal oxygen deprivation

**Impact on Classification**:
- Strong predictor of pathological outcomes
- Even single prolonged deceleration elevates risk classification
- Models use DP presence/frequency as critical decision factor

### Why These Features Make Medical Sense:

1. **Variability Dominance** (MSTV, ALTV, ASTV):
   - Established in medical literature as primary CTG interpretation criteria
   - Direct reflection of fetal autonomic nervous system integrity
   - Progressive loss of variability = progressive fetal compromise
   - Models correctly prioritize these features, aligning with clinical practice

2. **Baseline Measurements** (Mean):
   - Fundamental vital sign, analogous to blood pressure in adults
   - Provides context for all other measurements
   - Abnormal baseline limits fetal reserve for additional stressors

3. **Deceleration Patterns** (DP):
   - Acute warning signs requiring immediate action
   - Direct indicators of hypoxic events
   - Critical for preventing stillbirth or permanent neurological damage

### Comparison: RF vs XGBoost Feature Rankings

**Areas of Agreement**:
- Both prioritize variability metrics (MSTV, ALTV, ASTV)
- Both rank Mean FHR in top 5
- Both identify AC (Accelerations) as moderately important

**Areas of Disagreement**:
- **RF emphasizes**: ASTV (#1) and ALTV (#2) - abnormal variability patterns
- **XGBoost emphasizes**: MSTV (#1) and DP (#3) - mean variability and decelerations

**Medical Interpretation**:
- RF focuses on detecting abnormal patterns (ASTV, ALTV)
- XGBoost balances baseline measurements (MSTV, Mean) with acute events (DP)
- Both approaches are clinically valid - different perspectives on same underlying pathology
- Consensus ranking provides most robust feature set

### SHAP Interpretability Analysis

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provides model-agnostic explanations by:
- Computing contribution of each feature to individual predictions
- Showing both magnitude (importance) and direction (increase/decrease risk)
- Enabling visualization of feature interactions
- Validating model-based feature importance

#### SHAP Feature Importance

![SHAP Feature Importance](plot/feature_importance/06_shap_feature_importance.png)

**Figure 23**: SHAP-based feature importance for Random Forest and XGBoost. Color indicates feature value (red = high, blue = low), x-axis shows SHAP value (impact on prediction).

**Key Observations**:
- **SHAP confirms model importance**: Top features from SHAP match model-based rankings
- **Feature value effects visible**: Red dots (high values) for MSTV tend right (increase normal prediction)
- **Interaction effects**: Some features show split distributions, indicating interaction with other variables

#### SHAP Class-Specific Analysis

![SHAP Class-Specific](plot/feature_importance/07_shap_class_specific.png)

**Figure 24**: SHAP summary plots for each class (Normal, Suspect, Pathological) across both RF and XGBoost models. Each row represents one model, each column represents one class.

**Class-Specific Insights**:

**Normal Class (Left Column)**:
- **High MSTV** (red dots right): Strongly predicts normal outcome
- **High Mean FHR in normal range**: Supports normal classification
- **Low DP** (blue dots right): Absence of decelerations indicates health

**Suspect Class (Middle Column)**:
- **Moderate variability abnormalities**: ASTV/ALTV in intermediate ranges
- **Mixed deceleration patterns**: Some DP present but not severe
- **Borderline Mean FHR**: Slight deviations from normal range

**Pathological Class (Right Column)**:
- **Low MSTV** (blue dots right): Reduced variability strongly predicts pathology
- **High DP** (red dots right): Presence of prolonged decelerations indicates distress
- **Extreme ASTV/ALTV**: Severe variability abnormalities drive pathological predictions

### SHAP vs Model-Based Importance: Comparison

| Method | Advantages | Limitations |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Model-based** | • Fast to compute<br>• Algorithm-specific insights<br>• Easy to interpret | • Biased toward high-cardinality features<br>• Doesn't show direction of effects<br>• Model-dependent |
| **SHAP** | • Model-agnostic<br>• Shows effect direction<br>• Captures interactions<br>• Theoretically grounded | • Computationally expensive<br>• Requires many samples for stability<br>• Complex visualization |

**Our Approach**: Use both methods complementarily
- Model-based for quick feature ranking
- SHAP for detailed explanation and validation
- Consensus between methods increases confidence

### Clinical Validation of Feature Importance

Our findings align with established CTG interpretation guidelines:

✓ **FIGO Guidelines** (2015): Emphasize FHR variability as primary assessment criterion
✓ **NICE Guidelines** (2017): Classify CTG based on baseline rate, variability, and decelerations
✓ **ACOG Practice Bulletin** (2010): Identify absent variability and prolonged decelerations as Category III (abnormal)

**Conclusion**: Model feature importance reflects evidence-based clinical practice, supporting model validity and trustworthiness.

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Standard Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy
- **Balanced Accuracy**: Average recall per class (accounts for imbalance)
- **F1 Macro**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, averaged across classes
- **ROC AUC (OvR)**: One-vs-Rest area under ROC curve

#### Medical Metrics (per class)
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: TP / (TP + FN) - ability to detect positive cases
- **Specificity**: TN / (TN + FP) - ability to detect negative cases
- **PPV (Precision)**: TP / (TP + FP) - positive predictive value
- **NPV**: TN / (TN + FN) - negative predictive value

#### Clinical Cost Matrix

```
Predicted:     Normal  Suspect  Pathological
Actual:
Normal         0       1        5
Suspect        1       0        3
Pathological   20      10       0
```

**Rationale**:
- False negatives for pathological cases cost 20 (life-threatening)
- False positives for pathological cases cost 5 (overcautious but safe)
- Misclassifying suspect cases costs 1-3 (moderate consequences)
