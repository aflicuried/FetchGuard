- XGBoost (Baseline)

**Top 5 Consensus Features:**

| Rank | Feature | Avg Importance | Clinical Relevance |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | ASTV | 0.1019 | Abnormal Short Term Variability - indicates fetal distress |
| 2 | MSTV | 0.1142 | Mean Short Term Variability - baseline fetal health |
| 3 | Mean | 0.1153 | Mean FHR - baseline heart rate measurement |
| 4 | ALTV | 0.1091 | Abnormal Long Term Variability - key distress indicator |
| 5 | DP | 0.0871 | Decelerations Prolonged - critical warning sign |

**Visualizations Generated (7 plots + 1 CSV):**
1. Model-based importance comparison (RF vs XGB)
2. Top 5 features side-by-side comparison
3. Feature importance heatmap
4. Consensus feature ranking (all features)
5. Top 5 summary table with clinical significance
6. SHAP overall feature importance
7. SHAP class-specific analysis (3 classes × 2 models)
8. `consensus_feature_ranking.csv` - Full ranking data

**Key Insights:**
- **Variability metrics** (ASTV, MSTV, ALTV) are most important
- Strong agreement between RF and XGBoost feature rankings
- SHAP analysis confirms model-based importance
- Heart rate statistics (Mean, Median, Mode) highly predictive
- Deceleration patterns (DP, DL) critical for pathological cases

**Clinical Validation:**
- Top features align with medical literature on CTG interpretation
- Variability metrics are established indicators of fetal well-being
- Deceleration patterns are known warning signs
- Feature importance supports clinical decision-making
